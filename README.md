# shexviz

ShExViz is a tool for visualizing ShEx schemas. It is a python library that can be used to generate visual representations 
of ShEx schemas in the form of SVG and PNG images. It can also be used as module in a jupyter notenbook to generate visual representations of 
linked-data schemas. It is also a library that can be used to visualize ShEx schemas in other applications.

The library is still in heavy development and is not yet ready for production use. There are some examples
of the visualizations that can be generated in the [notebooks](notebooks/) folder.
